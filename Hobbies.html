<br>I love, LOVE reading. That's all there is to it. Reading is usually my go to thing to do in my free time, especially if I have a good book waiting for me. An unexplainable feeling washes me away when I crack open a good book, away into a completely different world. Who wouldn't want to read about someone else's problems instead of solving your own? Reading not only gives you knowledge and all that stuff, it gives you friends. Lifelong friends that you cry with, laugh with, explore with. Reading is magic</br>
